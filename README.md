2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract time-based features (e.g., holidays, weekends).
   - Handle missing data and outliers.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., Random Forests, LSTM).
   - Evaluate model performance.
4. **Deployment**:
   - Serve predictions via a REST API.
